# basic_app

A new Flutter project.



I  made this app for my day to day interactions with the Systems or the people to save my time. I know i am doing the things which i hate , i want to use less apps for storing data , but sometimes data skips from our mind at that time when we need data , i know that the data never deletes from the brain, but it lost somewhere in the data ocean , i need a net to capture that data , i am trying to build that net to capture data from the ocean of the infromation flowing in my mind, but rightnow i don't have that net , so i am creating this app to store my data.Data means like the information i am gathering from my day to day experiences like am i taking notes from the System Design videos(tech Videos) , politics videos (mainly geopolitics), Religion based knowledge , i will make this app and stroe my thoughts into the form of videos and audios because they are the fastest form to store data , i known in terms of a  computer science student it will take memory and it is not a good option , but i am making this app to boost my productivity, ya ya i will save in text format also , but i will make this app without looking at the "Notes app" video.

The basic idea for this app to store data :
Make a home page whichn consist of only the options which will be added in the app later and i will make some categories to work in the app .
